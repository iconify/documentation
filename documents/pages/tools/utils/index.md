## Advanced usage {#advanced}

Iconify Utils can do only basic parsing of `[type]IconifyJSON` and `[type]IconifyIcon` data. It is not meant for more complex stuff.

For more complex stuff, such as importing icons, validating icon code, changing palette, cleaning up, exporting to various formats, see [Iconify Tools package](../tools2/index.md).
