# Icons

This section of documentation is about icons and icon sets.

## Basics

If you are new to Iconify ecosystem the following articles should help you understand how icons and icon sets are organised:

- [Icon basics](./icon-basics.md) - naming rules, types of icons, cleanup.
- [Icon set basics](./icon-set-basics.md) - what are icon sets, data format, naming, how to parse them.

## Open source icons {#data}

There are over 60,000 icons available from more than 80 open source icon sets, which you can use in your projects.

All icons are:

- Open source.
- Validated and cleaned up.
- Automatically kept up to date.

See [how to get icon data](./icon-data.md) for list of packages and repositories where you can get icon data.

Iconify ecosystem offers [many tools to help developers use these icons](../usage/index.md).

## Custom icons {#custom}

You can also use Iconify with custom icons.
