# Iconify for designers

For designers, Iconify ecosystem offers several ways to easily import icons in various design tools.

Available options:

- Figma users can install [Iconify plug-in for Figma](./figma/index.md).
- Sketch users can install [Iconify plugin-in for Sketch](./sketch/index.md).
- For other design tools, or if you are experiencing issues with plug-ins listed above, you can copy and paste SVG from one of sources listed below.

## Browse icons

You can browse and search more than 60k open source icons at one of the following websites:

- [Iconify icon sets](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/) - official website.
- [Icones](https://icones.js.org/) - alternative website created by Anthony Fu.

Find icon you want, select it, copy SVG to clipboard, paste it to your favorite design tool.

Possible issues:

- Some design tools do not support `[prop]currentColor`. Set icon color to black before copying code sample.
- Almost all image editing software do not support SVG 2 animations. Animated icons will be imported without animations, sometimes rendered weirdly.
