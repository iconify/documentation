<div>
	These icons are supposed to be square, but only one attribute is set in
	stylesheet:
	<span class="iconify set-height" data-icon="mdi:eyedropper"></span>
	<span class="iconify set-width" data-icon="mdi:eyedropper"></span>
</div>
<div>
	If both attributes are set in stylesheet, icon scales correctly:
	<span class="iconify set-height set-width" data-icon="mdi:eyedropper"></span>
</div>
<div>
	These icons are square in modern browsers, but fail in Internet Explorer,
	which is unfortunately still used by enough people to support it (update: this
	is irrelevant now, demo was written a while ago). You can use this method, but
	better just avoid it:
	<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi:eyedropper" height="48"></span>
	<span class="iconify" data-icon="mdi:eyedropper" width="48"></span>
</div>
