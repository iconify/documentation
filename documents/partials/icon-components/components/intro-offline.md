Retrieving icon data from Iconify API requires visitor to be online. What if you want to use component offline or on local network?

If you do not want to use API, you need to provide icon component with data for all icons you are using. There are several options:

- You can build [icon bundles](/icon-components/bundles/index.md) for icons that are used in your application, making icon data available offline.
- You can use [individual icon packages](/icons/icons.md), which is similar to icon bundles, but import icons one by one and are easier to use.
