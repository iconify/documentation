Icons have 2 modes: inline and block. Difference between modes is `[prop]vertical-align` that is added to inline icons.

Inline icons are aligned slightly below baseline, so they look centred compared to text, like glyph fonts.

Block icons do not have alignment, like images, which aligns them to baseline by default.

Alignment option was added to make icons look like continuation of text, behaving like glyph fonts. This should make migration from glyph fonts easier and simplify code when icons are used in text, such as emojis.
